"**What is a  AS5600?**

*12-Bit Programmable Contactless Potentiometer**

The AS5600 is an easy to program magnetic rotary position sensor with a high-resolution 12-bit analog or PWM output. This contactless system measures the absolute angle of a diametric magnetized on-axis magnet. 

This is a Micropython library for reading an AS5600 using I2C.  It was developed on a Seeedstudio board and Raspberry Pi Pico.  It should work with other MCU's running Micropython but I2C setup may differ on on other boards.  It may work on circuit python but I have not tested this.

The field names are taken from the data sheet. All registers in the data sheet are implemented, as simple attributes of the AS5600 class.   You will need to read the datasheet to use the library.



Example file

This is an early work in progress.  I ran a small  endless loop program then waved a magnet around.  I seemed to get sensible values from RAWANGLE but obviously a mechanical better setup is required.

The MD field never seemed to say a magnet was not detected although reasonable values were being generated by RAW ANGLE.  I am not sure why this is so, at this stage.  So some debugging will be required.  AGC levels seem very low.
